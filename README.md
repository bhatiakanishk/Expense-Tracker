TOPIC : Expense Tracker

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
This application will help people to keep an accurate record of their money inflow and outflow. Many people live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the
end of the month they don’t have sufficient money to meet their needs. The main reason for this problem is poor money management skills. People tend to overspend
without realizing it, and this can prove to be disastrous. 
Using an expense tracker will help people to keep track of how much they spend every day and on what. At the end of the month, they will have a clear picture of 
where their money is going. This is one of the best ways to get your expenses under control and bring some semblance of order to your finances.
